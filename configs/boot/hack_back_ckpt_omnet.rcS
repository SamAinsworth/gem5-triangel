# This is a tricky script to understand. When run in M5, it creates
# a checkpoint after Linux boot up, but before any benchmarks have
# been run. By playing around with environment variables, we can
# detect whether the checkpoint has been taken.
#  - If the checkpoint hasn't been taken, the script allows M5 to checkpoint the system,
# re-read this script into a new tmp file, and re-run it. On the
# second execution of this script (checkpoint has been taken), the
# environment variable is already set, so the script will exit the
# simulation
#  - When we restore the simulation from a checkpoint, we can
# specify a new script for M5 to execute in the full-system simulation,
# and it will be executed as if a checkpoint had just been taken.
